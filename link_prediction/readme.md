# MovieLens Link Prediction Tutorial Project

## Overview

In this project, I followed a comprehensive tutorial to build a Graph Neural Network (GNN) using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric (PyG). The objective was to implement link prediction on the MovieLens dataset to understand how GNNs can manage complex data structures, specifically heterogeneous graphs. This project serves as a testament to my learning journey in the field of AI and GNNs.

## Project Goals

- **Understand GNN Concepts**: Deepen my understanding of Graph Neural Networks and their applications.
- **PyTorch Proficiency**: Enhance skills in PyTorch and related libraries, focusing on practical implementations.
- **Data Handling**: Learn to process and manipulate real-world datasets for use in neural network training.

## Implementation Details

- **Dataset Processing**: Utilized the MovieLens dataset to create a heterogeneous graph consisting of users and movies.
- **GNN Architecture**: Built the GNN using PyTorch Geometric, with features like `SAGEConv`, `HeteroData`, and `LinkNeighborLoader`.
- **Training and Validation**: Focused on model training, hyperparameter tuning, and validation accuracy.

## Challenges Faced

- **Library Integration**: Encountered and resolved issues with library dependencies and environment setup.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Learned the intricacies of transforming traditional datasets for use in GNNs.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **AI and Machine Learning**: Application of theoretical concepts in AI through practical implementation.
- **Software Development**: Followed best practices in software development, including version control and code documentation.
- **Problem-Solving**: Applied critical thinking and problem-solving skills in overcoming implementation challenges.
